This article refers to AI and its role in the art hemisphere - namely, how people are using it to generate artwork or using it for publications, contests, etc. The article discusses how someone won an art competition "without breaking any rules" and doing so with AI-generated art. 

I find this incredibly interesting because AI-art is often trained off of a real person's style, and while art is subjective, I do think that AI-generated art is a form of 'stealing' (since as far as I know some software is trained off of a real person's style, and they didn't necessarily give consent), as well as having some moral and ethical questions in regards to how it is used. I do think many people are valid in being frustrated with how AI is used (and abused), regardless of how helpful a tool it may be.
